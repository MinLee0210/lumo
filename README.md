## ‚úÖ Feature Checklist

### Models

- [x] OpenAI Models (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini)
- [x] Ollama Integration
- [ ] Hugging Face API support
- [ ] Open-source model integration via Candle 

You can use models like Groq, TogetherAI using the same API as OpenAI. Just give the base url and the api key.

### Agents

- [x] Tool-Calling Agent
- [x] CodeAgent
- [x] Planning Agent
- [x] Multi-Agent Support

The code agent is still in development, so there might be python code that is not yet supported and may cause errors. Try using the tool-calling agent for now.

### Tools

- [x] Google Search Tool
- [x] DuckDuckGo Tool
- [x] Website Visit & Scraping Tool
- [ ] RAG Tool
- More tools to come...

### Other

- [ ] E2B Sandbox
- [ ] Streaming output
- [ ] Improve logging

## üöÄ Quick Start

### CLI Usage

Warning: Since there is no implementation of a Sandbox environment, be careful with the tools you use. Preferrably run the agent in a controlled environment using a Docker container.

#### Using Cargo

```bash
cargo install lumo --all-features
```

```bash
lumo -t "Your task here"
```
You need to set the API key as an environment variable. Otherwise you can pass it as an argument.

#### Using Docker

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull your-username/lumo:latest

# Run with your OpenAI API key
docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here lumo -t "What is the latest news about Rust programming?"
```

  -m, --model-type <MODEL_TYPE>  The type of model to use [default: open-ai] [possible values: open-ai, ollama]
  -k, --api-key <API_KEY>        OpenAI API key (only required for OpenAI model)
      --model-id <MODEL_ID>      Model ID (e.g., "gpt-4" for OpenAI or "qwen2.5" for Ollama) [default: gpt-4o-mini]
  -p, --planning-interval        Number of steps to take to update the plan
  -b, --base-url <BASE_URL>      Base URL for the API
